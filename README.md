# ruderpedalssingleaxis
I've been really into helicopter flying in DCS lately and with the Apache coming out this month I'm quite a few of you out there might be interested in doing a project like this.
The most difficult part of this project was the mechanical aspect since it is only a single axis.
I considered adding toe brakes but since I'm mostly flying the Huey I didn't.
